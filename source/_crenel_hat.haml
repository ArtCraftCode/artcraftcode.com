  %h2 Pattern notes
  %p As written, fits women's medium loosely (21in/53cm), or men's medium snugly (23in/58 cm). My husband says this hat fits him perfectly!

  %h2 Sizing up or down
  %p Simply add or subtract 7 from your cast on number to make the hat larger or smaller.
  %p If you're making this hat much larger (or much smaller), you may need to add (or remove) decrease rows to compensate.
  %p The decreases are too many rows for baby hats, but you should be able to work anywhere from toddler to a large menâ€™s size without adjustments to the decreases.
